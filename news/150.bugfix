Add GitHub Actions to project.
Run tests there in a matrix against Zope 4 and Zope 5, Windows and Linux, Python 27, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.
Testing Python 2.7 on Windows is skipped.
Refactor tox test setup slightly, do not use tox on GitHub.
Split up tests in smaller easier to maintain files.
Fix tests to run on Windows without tocuhing the recipe code (the Windows code is not perfect right now, but it test are reflecting current state).
This primary includes respecting path-handling (backslash vs slash), conditional instance generation and differences in wsgi configurations.
